Formix-mui is a Formix and MUI library that can provide a simple way of connecting MUI Fields with your Formix form.

### Dependencies

  - You can learn more about MUI [here](mui.com/)

## Usage

We've separated the logical part of the component, which has the minimum responsibilities to be as generic as possible, so we use Mobx for state management to make this happen.

The complete documentation is under construction, we will soon make it available.

A simple example of what a component's usage pattern looks like:

_In this example we are using Next but the idea can be used for other React applications_

```ts
import { Formix } from '@euk-labs/formix';
import { FXPasswordField } from '@euk-labs/formix-mui';

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Formix
      initialValues={{
        email: '',
        password: '',
        birthDate: '',
      }}
      onSubmit={(values: any) => alert(JSON.stringify(values))}
    >
      <FXTextField label="E-mail" name="email" />
      <FXPasswordField label="Senha" name="password" />
      <FXDatePicker label="Data nascimento" name="birthDate" />
    </Formix>
  );
}

export default MyForm;
```
